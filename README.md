# BigDataEmotionDetector


Initial Idea:
By publish tweets or all kinds of other publicly available texts, human behaviour becomes predictable, because most of the emotional responses of humans are simple and stereotypical. Therefore can be study and analyse by machine learning models.


## Emotion Recognition Model

One proposed function of mental imagery is to make thoughts more emotionally evocative through sensory simulation. This can be helpful both in planning for future events and in remembering the past, but also a hindrance when thoughts become overwhelming and maladaptive, such as in anxiety disorders. Models of human cognition propose that mental imagery exists for aiding thought predictions by linking them to emotions, allowing us to simulate and ‘try out’ future scenarios, as if we are experiencing them and their resulting emotional outcomes, aiding us in decision making.

There are two types of emotion measurement and assessment tools: psychophysiological and self-report assessment. With the developments of relevant research, researchers have begun progressively shifting attention toward research on user emotion in human-computer interaction.
